# Microchimerism Literature Atlas

The [Microchimerism Literature Atlas (MCLA)](https://literature-atlas.microchimerism.info) is an advanced literature dataset offering powerful tools for exploring and analyzing over 15,000 references in the field of MC research. 

The literature tool is programmed in such a way that it can be easily adapted to meet oneâ€™s own need for a literature dataset,  e.g., by downloading and preprocessing a custom literature dataset or by changing the possible filter keywords. 
The files for customizing the literature tool can be found in: 
- preprocessing/data/,
- preprocessing/pubmed.R and 
- web_app/global.R


The MCLA is build by downloading in a preprocessing step from PubMed, cleaned, and processed to save server performance.

## Features

- **Modular Structure**: Navigate different sections via a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI).
- **Data Table**: View key information in an expandable table with options for multidimensional searches and data export (CSV, TXT, XLSX).
- **Advanced Search**: Execute precise queries with support for word parts, phrases, and logical operators (AND, OR, NOT).

## Functional Sections

- **Chart View**: Visualize publication data, keyword frequency, and author activity. Graphs adapt to active filter settings, allowing tailored insights.
- **Network View**: Investigate the citation network to understand the relationships between papers. Highlight connections and access detailed paper information by hovering over nodes.
- **Filter Settings**: Craft and apply complex search strings to refine your searches, enhancing specificity and relevance.

The MCLA is designed to be an essential resource for researchers, providing powerful tools for comprehensive and efficient literature analysis in the field of microchimerism.
